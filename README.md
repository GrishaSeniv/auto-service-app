+ A person's discount on goods = the number of his orders * 1%
+ A person's discount on favors = the number of his orders * 2%
+ Master's salary = 40% of the cost of the service he was engaged in

  "paid"
+ When changing the status of the order to "successfully completed" or "unsuccessful
  completed", the completion date is equal to the current date
